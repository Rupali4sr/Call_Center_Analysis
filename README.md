# Call_Center_Analysis
PWC Switzerland Virtual Internship Task 1

As a part of the PWC Switzerland Virtual Internship Program offered by Forage, I have created "Call Center Analysis" dashboard using Power BI. This dataset containing call records from a customer service center. The attributes in this data are: Call Id, Agent, Date, Time, Topic, Answerd(Y/N), Resolved, Speed of ans in Sec, Satisfaction rating and Avg talk duration.

# üéØObjective
To deliver meaningful insights and actionable information to empover the Call Center.

# üîç Exploring Insights
 Agent Performance
   * Identify top performing agent based on number of calls answerd and resolved.
   * Analyse the distribution of call duration and satisfaction rating.
 Call Volume Trend
   * Visualize trends in call volume over time to identify peak hours/day.
   * Determine if there is any seasonal patterns or spike in call volume.
 Customer Satisfaction
   * Track customer satisfaction rating across different agents.
   * Identify factors contributing high or low customer satisfaction scores.
   

  These insights will provide valuable insights into the performance and efficiency of call service center, enabling data-driven decision-making  to enhance customer satisfaction and operational effectiveness.
